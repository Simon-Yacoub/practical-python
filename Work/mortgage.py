Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $500,000 with Guidoâ€™s Mortgage, Stock Investment, and Bitcoin trading corporation. 
The interest rate is 5% and the monthly payment is $2684.11.
Here is a program that calculates the total amount that Dave will have to pay over the life of the mortgage:
"""
principal = 500000.0
rate = 0.05 #interest
payment = 2684.11 #monthly payment
total_paid = 0.0
months = 0

while principal > 0:
    if(months < 12):
        principal = principal * (1+rate/12) - (payment + 1000) #Dave makes an extra 1000$ payment in first 12 months
        total_paid = total_paid + payment + 1000 
    else:
        principal = principal * (1+rate/12) - payment
        total_paid = total_paid + payment
    
    months += 1
    

print('Total paid', total_paid, 'Months', months)
